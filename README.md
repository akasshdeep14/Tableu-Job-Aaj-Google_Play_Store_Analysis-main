# TB01-Google_Play_Store_Analysis  

 

he Google Play Store App Insights Dashboard successfully consolidates multiple performance dimensions—ratings, installs, reviews, update trends, app size, and genre—into a single, interactive view that supports data-driven decision-making.

The analysis reveals that high app ratings are not always directly linked to high install counts, indicating that popularity and quality do not always grow together. Apps with moderate to high installs tend to maintain more stable ratings, while extremely popular apps often face rating variability due to scalability and diverse user expectations. Additionally, certain genres such as Education, Productivity, and Books & Reference consistently achieve higher average ratings, highlighting stronger user satisfaction in these segments.

The update trend analysis shows a steady increase in app updates over time, confirming that regular maintenance is a critical industry practice for sustaining engagement and relevance. Furthermore, the app size vs installs analysis demonstrates that lightweight and optimized apps attract more downloads, especially in competitive markets.

By integrating global filters (Category, App Type, and Content Rating) and a clean, structured dashboard layout, the solution enables stakeholders to explore insights dynamically across different market segments. This ensures the dashboard is not only analytical but also strategic and actionable.

Overall, the Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive, user-centric view of app success factors, enabling app developers, product managers, and business leaders to:  
1) Benchmark high-performing apps  
2) Optimize app size and update frequency  
3) Focus on high-satisfaction genres  
4) Balance growth strategies with quality assurance  

This project demonstrates how visual analytics in Tableau can transform raw app data into meaningful business insights, supporting smarter decisions and sustainable app growth.
